## ðŸ’»Step 1
Set Up our Development Instance
- Let's launch an EC2 instance to develop our web app.
  
## Set up an IAM Admin User
1)	Create an IAM user with AdministratorAccess if you don't have one already.
2)	Log in to the AWS console using your IAM Admin User.

## Launch an EC2 Instance
 Launch an EC2 instance with the following configurations:
   1) AMI: Amazon Linux 2023
   2) Instance type: t2.micro
   3) Key pair: nextwork-keypair (Create a new one if needed and store the .pem file in a DevOps folder on your Desktop)
   4) Network settings:
     - Allow SSH traffic from: My IP

## Install VS Code
1)	Install VS Code if you haven't already.
2)	Open VS Code and open a new terminal.
3)	Navigate to the DevOps folder in our terminal: cd ~/Desktop/DevOps (Mac/Linux) or cd C:\Users\YourUserName\Desktop\DevOps (Windows).
4)	Change permissions of your .pem file:
5)	Mac/Linux: chmod 400 nextwork-keypair.pem
6)	Windows:

## Set up our EC2 Instance
1)	Connect to your EC2 instance using SSH from your VS Code terminal.
2)	Install Maven, Java and Git on your EC2 instance by running these commands :

 -  Verify installations:
1)	mvn -v (check for Maven version 3.5.x)
2)	java -version (check for Java 8)
3)	git -v
## Create the Application
1) Generate a Java web app using Maven:

## Connect VS Code with your EC2 Instance
1)	Connect VS Code to your EC2 instance using the Remote-SSH extension.
2)  Open the nextwork-web-project folder in VS Code on your EC2 instance.
3)  Modify index.jsp in src/main/webapp with your name.

## Add, commit, and push your code to GitHub

1)	Add, commit, and push your code:
2) 	Use a personal access token (PAT) instead of your password when prompted for credentials.
3)	Verify your code is in your GitHub repository.

ðŸ“¦ Step #2
## Set up CodeArtifact Repository
Set up AWS CodeArtifact to manage your web app's packages.


NOW,
## 1. Create a CodeArtifact repository with: 
1)	Repository name: nextwork-devops-cicd
2)	Package format: Maven
3)	Enable public upstream repositories: Maven Central
4)	Domain name: nextwork (or use existing)
5)	Get connection instructions for Maven.
## 2. Create IAM policy and role for CodeArtifact access.
1)	Create an IAM policy named codeartifact-nextwork-consumer-policy with the following JSON:
2)	Create an IAM role named ec2-instance-nextwork-cicd for EC2, and attach the codeartifact-nextwork-consumer-policy.
3)	Attach the ec2-instance-nextwork-cicd IAM role to your EC2 instance
## 3. Connect CodeArtifact and Maven.
1)	Export CodeArtifact auth token in your EC2 terminal using the command from connection instructions.
2)	Create settings.xml in your project root directory.
3)	Copy and paste steps #4-6 from CodeArtifact connection instructions into settings.xml within <settings> tags.
4)	Build your project using Maven: mvn compile -s settings.xml.
5)	Verify packages in your CodeArtifact repository.
